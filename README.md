KVSrecorder is a professional-grade audio recording and analysis application designed for capturing high-quality voice samples with comprehensive metadata, particularly for forensic applications and voice analysis. It provides a clean, user-friendly interface while offering advanced technical capabilities for audio professionals.

## Overview

This tool is designed to produce legally defensible voice recordings with detailed metadata, waveform analysis, and spectrograms. KVSrecorder focuses on audio chain integrity through detailed logs, hash verification, and comprehensive reports suitable for evidentiary use.

## Features

- **Professional Audio Recording**: Multi-format recording with customizable sample rates, bit depths, and codecs
- **Dual Format Recording**: Simultaneously record in two different formats (e.g., WAV + MP3)
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live waveform display and level meter during recording
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Generate detailed PDF reports with waveforms, spectrograms, and complete technical metadata
- **Audio Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification and detailed logging of all recording parameters
- **Format Support**: Records in WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, and M4A with various codec options
- **Modern Interface**: Clean, responsive GUI with a professional blue and white theme
- **Technical Analysis**: Audio statistics including RMS level, peak measurements, and dynamic range

## Installation

### Prerequisites
